## Overview
I used a supervised regression model for this project, in order to determine whether the tissue sample is benign or malignant. This involved me importing the data, performing an analysis, then cleaning, scaling, and modeling the data.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to find a model that results in a high accuracy rate for determining whether tissue is malignant or benign based off the other data it is given. This technology can be used in hospital to help doctors more accurately determine if somone could have a potentially life-threatening health concern. This is considered a supervised model because we know the two possible outcomes the model can result in- malignant or benign.

## Data
I downloaded this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). The data is retrieved using a fine needle aspirate of a breast tumor to describe the characteristics of the cell. There were 500 different cases in this study and 30 attributes to help determine whether the mass is benign or malignant.
